Regression App

Purpose:

Perform multiple linear regression along with the assumption test that must be met automatically and also perform predictions with the multiple linear regression model

Manual:

*In the regression app, there is a default data set, namely e-commerce data.

*If you want to load new data, you can choose "browse" in the "upload csv files" section or by pasting the data into the "Paste Data from Clipboard" box, then click "Load Data".

*To display the correlation matrix of the numeric variables in the data, click the "Display Correlation Matrix" button.

*You can choose the percentage of the data splitting before performing regression by sliding the slider on the Train/Test Splitting Percentage.

*To perform multiple linear regression, select the response variable and predictor variables in the provided columns, then click "Run Multiple Linear Regression", then the regression will be performed automatically and the results of the regression model and assumption test will be obtained.

*To perform predictions on the model, click "Run Model Predictions for test Data". The prediction will be performed automatically based on the test data.

*You can also enter the value of the predictor variables manually to perform predictions in the column provided. This column will be available after the regression model is created.

Limitations of the application:

*There is no separator symbol setting when loading data with csv.
*The output results of the prediction with test data and manual prediction cannot be displayed simultaneously.
*The elimination of insignificant variables still needs to be done manually.
*There are still many bugs so the application is prone to crashing.


ANOVA App

Purpose:
This app performs an ANOVA test on data, along with automatically checking the assumptions that must be met.

Instructions:

*The ANOVA app comes with a default dataset of ad placement data, which shows the Click Trough Rate (CTR) for each placement location.

*To load new data, you can either select "Browse" in the "Upload CSV files" section or paste the data into the "Paste Data from Clipboard" box and then click "Load Data". The data table and boxplot will be displayed automatically.

*To perform an ANOVA test, select the factor variable and response variable in the provided columns, then click "Run ANOVA". The regression will be performed automatically and the results of the ANOVA model and assumption tests will be displayed.

App limitations:
*There is currently no option to set the separator symbol when loading CSV data.
*The boxplot that is displayed does not yet capture each factor from categorical variables.
*Errors may still occur in the app.


notes:
The application is still under development, so there may be errors or limitations.
If you find any errors or limitations, please report them to the developer.
